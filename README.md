# Hi, I'm Thomas

This is my personal website. It's built in Astro, Tailwind, MDX, and a sprinkle of Svelte.

## Ideas

- [ ] Easter eggs!
- [X] View count on articles
- [ ] TOC (Maybe akin to Rauno's bird-eye view)
- [ ] Animated SVG signature path
- [ ] Open-source video showcasing website
- [ ] Article highighter and sharer
  - [ ] Maybe a kindle-like commonly-highlighted?
- [ ] Preview link component for all links (using a build-time screenshot API?)
- [ ] Go back feature when clicking on internal links
