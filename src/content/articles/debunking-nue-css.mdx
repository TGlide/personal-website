## What is Nue CSS?

Nue CSS is the latest release of the web framework [Nue](https://nuejs.org/).
It is created by [Tero Piirainen](https://twitter.com/tipiirai), who is (in)famous for
their bold statements about the web.<Footnote href='#footnotes' number={1} />

As such, the [announcement for Nue CSS](https://nuejs.org/blog/introducing-nue-css/) couldn't be any different.
There are a number of claims that I'll be putting to the test here.

![Nue CSS blog post screenshot](/articles/debunking-nue-css/post-screenshot.png)

But, what is Nue CSS exactly? It seems to be a way of *thinking* about CSS, rather
than a library. Before getting to it, the article goes through existing methodologies, such as BEM, CSS-in-JS,
Tailwind *(Tero's mortal enemy, after Adam Wathan famously stole their lunch money)*<Footnote href='#footnotes' number={2} />, and states their tradeoffs.

So what's the magical solution? Nue CSS, of course!

The author quotes big names, such as *Steve Jobs*, and *Dieter Rams*, to explain how its all too simple:
You should define a design system, and make it simple. Then you don't have to define a lot of classes or properties!

There's not much else to it, really. It doesn't tackle much about scale, conflict resolution with naming, etc.
When looking into one of the templates, *Aimee*, the CSS is actually quite lean. You have some global files,
and then some unique css files per page. That's it.

> One line of CSS is easier to maintain than a hundred lines.

It does makes me wonder why they didn't just added scoped styles, which would still have all the benefits
they've mentioned, without having to worry too much about naming.

Nonetheless, with such minimalism, Tero claims there are huge benefits to performance.

Let's stop right there for a bit.

## Tailwind Button vs Nue CSS template

The comparison is made on bad faith.

It includes the base part of Tailwind, including the preflight, which is *optional*. 

It also ignores an important fact: As your site grows, Tailwind
requires *less* newly-generated CSS by design, something which is hard to achieve traditionally.

A button in isolation may be quite hefty, for sure. 
A button within other Tailwind buttons, however, is quite small, smaller than traditional CSS. 
I have an experiment about this [here](https://github.com/TGlide/tailwind-benchmark).

Even so, I decided to remove the preflight, and include only the necessary classes for it: 
[Tailwind Playground](https://play.tailwindcss.com/EGDjh1OY9h)

It's much leaner now, with the CSS going to *814 Bytes*, and reducing the size of said button to about the size of the 
template's CSS.

And that's not all, Aimee's CSS file size is actually bigger, at least when I measured locally.
It comes in at *5644 bytes* total.

So the claims don't exactly hold up.

## Building fast websites!

Tero uses an approach for Nue CSS that's interesting. It all gets inlined in the HTML.
They claim this gets you to a performance level that cannot get achieved with a normal
bundler.

Good thing I recreated the template in Tailwind and Astro, and I got similar results! Only SEO wasn't at 100, because
I couldn't be bothered to do it. I've published the recreation if you want to [see for yourself](https://amie-tw-test.pages.dev/).

So yes, their approach is fast, but the claims about others being slow, 
doesn't hold up *as a rule*. You can build slow websites with any tech-stack, and it definitely is possible 
to build fast websites with *Turbo-Infuced-Rust-Bundler* powered stacks.

Besides, there are other things that are really important in building websites, that Tero overlooked
when building these templates.


### Troubles in Nue-land

When playing around with the *Aimee* template for my recreation, I noticed several issues.

- It applies `role="button"` to an anchor tag, which is a misuse of a11y attributes.
- The `alt` tags for some images are severely lacking
	- Some images don't even have alt tags!
- Not all links have discernible text
- Fails WCAG compliance in colors throughout the website
- The `dialog` element is being misused. Rather than trigger it using JS, it uses
some "clever"<Footnote href="#footnotes" number={3} /> CSS to display it. This makes it so focus-trapping, and other default dialog behavior
gets totally ignored, which is an accessibility and usability nightmare.
- Repeated unnecessary markup, contributing to page bloat.
- The CSS gets quite hard to follow. Some elements are affected by multiple different files, making
it difficult to grasp which styles are being applied where.
- Typos! I'm sure someone will find a typo in my site too, this is just a nitpick ðŸ˜ˆ

I point these out because I think its important that a template should serve as a good starting point, 
and as such these faults should not be ignored. 

Unfortunately, this is common-place in the web. Accessibility is hard and engaging people to improve it is even harder.


## Scalability

Okay, so I lied. Tero does mention scalability, but not in the way you'd expect. 

They say Nue CSS helps you with scalability, by offloading the responsibility from one 
single JS/React developer, and shifting it to UI/UX developers. 

What Tero doesn't mention though is, for the latter developers, how does Nue CSS scale for them? 
There's no mention of it whatsoever.

I'm only left to guess that either 
- *A.* They didn't think about it or 
- *B.* They thought it wasn't a valid concern for this approach

Either option is shortsighted. Designs gain complexity over time, and managing 
them is tricky. 

Unless Nue CSS is only suitable for simple projects, which would
definitely make it unscaleable.

## Other mentions

Tero talks about how vanilla CSS stands the test of time, and is forever understandable, 
ignoring that best-practices and commonly-used properties shift constantly. 

Have you seen people using `float` a lot these days? 

With the ever-growing list of CSS features, the way we write CSS will constantly change,
and things will become legacy. Such is the nature of things.

I'm also quite eager to see their plans for a global design system, 
[pitched by Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-global-design-system/). 
Its one of the next big things in the Nue roadmap.


Tero thinks its the next big thing in CSS, even though Brad mentions it shouldn't care about styling
too much.

Nonetheless, it's an exciting idea, for which I have some plans of my own...

## Closing Notes

It's become evident that it's hard not to get *dogmatic* about our tech stacks. 

Twitter threads and Reddit ramblings are a sore-but-common sight, where people grumble and fight about why 
everything else but their own choice *sucks*, and we get obsessed with trying to prove the other side wrong with 
benchmarks, Lighthouse scores, or any other way of keeping ourselves in a bubble.

I *try* and approach these with a more sober view. 

Things rarely do suck as badly as people say. Frameworks and libraries were built for a purpose, and have 
thought behind it, they're not built on a whim! 

They all start with a single purpose: *to solve a problem*.

That's true for Nue as well. Even though I refute a lot of Tero's claims, it does have its own merits. 
It's quite fast and minimal, making it a good fit if you're looking for that above all else.

So instead of trying to ~*shit*~ on others to try and make your preferred weapon of choice look good,
solve the problems you find, and people will come to you.

Besides, if we're all still making un-accessible messy websites no matter the stack, I say
we have more important matters to address.

This is the first article I've published on my new website. 

I've been wanting to do this for quite a long time. 
Even though I've wondered if many people would even see it, I guess it's also a way to put order to my thoughts.

It's also great fun!

I'd love to discuss about the points above, including with Tero. 
<br/>Feel free to reach out at any time!

I also linked some resources I love below about styling and accessibility, which I
believe will help you build great websites.

Thank you.
