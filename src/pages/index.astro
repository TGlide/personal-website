    <h2>Who am I</h2>

    <p>
      Still figuring it out. In the meanwhile, I assume many roles and titles.
      <br />
      <em>Web Developer</em>, <em>OSS Maintainer</em>, <em>Designer</em>, <em>Docs Writer</em
      >,
      <em>Speaker</em>, <em>etc.</em>
      <br />
      <br />
      Through my passion, I've been fortunate to become a <em>Svelte ambassador</em
      >, work with inspiring companies such as <em>V7</em>, <em>Appwrite</em>,
      and <em>Significa</em>, and meet my heroes both online and personally.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm trying to put my work out there, both to leave my mark, and to try and
      make world a <em>tiny</em> bit better with it. I've put some of it below.

          One of my first public experiments, and a fun one to build.
          <br />
          <br />
          Was awesome to see Rauno himself notice it!

    <h2>Work experience</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Currently at <em>V7</em>, I'm working on a <em>super-duper-secret</em> project
        that acts as a natural interface to AI that you'll be astonished wasn't made
        sooner.
        <br />
        I work on the main UI of said project, sprinkling in a lot of love into every
        crevice, crafting beautiful interfaces with natural animations and interactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        At <em>Appwrite</em>, I worked a lot on the <em>Console</em>, but my
        presence was more felt within the more flashy sections seen on the <em>Website</em
        >, the
        <em>init</em> launch week, and the <em>marketing campaigns</em>.
        <br />
        <br />
        It also signaled the start of my journey into <em>Open Source</em>. I
        got to interact with its expansive <em>community</em>, and directly
        contribute to OSS for a living. It <em>inspired</em> me to create my own
        projects, with great success so far.
      </li>
      <li>
        At <em>Significa</em>, I acted a <em>Frontend Developer</em> working on a
        variety of projects, from <em>websites</em> to <em>web apps</em>, <em>mobile apps</em
        >, and even <em>design systems</em>. I also mentored a lot of the junior
        developers.
        <br />
        <br />
        I learned a ton about <em>animation</em> and <em>design</em> there. Their
        website has tons of case studies in projects I worked on, such as <em>Dia</em
        >, <em>Kota</em>
        and <em>Cimple</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        At <em>Stone Pagamentos</em>, I started my career into the <em>www</em> sphere.
        I learned quickly, developing products that the support team would use to
        serve clients throughout all of <em>Brazil</em>.
        <br />
        <br />
        The quick page was <em>fun</em>, <em>demanding</em>, and <em>energetic</em
        >. To this day I still miss being able to directly request feedback from
        the end-user, since they were my colleagues.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've done some <em>freelancing</em> as well, but nothing of major note.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Extra</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Psst.</em> This site is a work in progress. I'm going big into design this
      year, and re-imagining my personal brand. Expect this to change quite a lot.
