					A delightful app to use, and create. Still one of the most fun projects I worked on!
					Featuring custom multi-axis sliders that triggered dynamic animations, hand-made charts,
					tons of micro-interactions and animations, and a lot of love.

					I worked on this website while it was still called Yonder (hence the video).
					It changed a lot since then, and unfortunately some of the hard-worked animations
					I worked on are now gone.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nonetheless, I learned a lot from it, and it was a great experience. The colorful
					design reflects a lot of the joy we had building it.
				</p>

					Luckily, the

					is still there! Try and find the ðŸ¥š
